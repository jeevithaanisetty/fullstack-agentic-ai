Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" 
language due to its comprehensive standard library.Keywords in Python include: False, True, 
None, and, as, assert, async, await, def, del, elif, else, break, class, continue, except, 
finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return,
